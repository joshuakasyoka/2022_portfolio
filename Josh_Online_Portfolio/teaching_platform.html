        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">One of the new features was a progress chart, where teachers could clearly see the progress made by their entire class on a specific course.<br><br> If a student was stuck on the course the teacher would be able to look at the student's statistics and identify the specific slide causing difficulty by clicking through a drop-down menu.</p></div>
