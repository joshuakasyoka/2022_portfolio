        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">While working for Turinglab I got the chance to redesign their website. This is because the old website looked a bit old-school and needed some sprucing up.</p></div>
        <div class="projects"><img class="dimensions" style="width: 25%" src="assets/Mobile-Phone-Prototype.gif"></div>
        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">Using Mix Panel we realised a lot of Turinglab's customers accessed the platform on their mobile devices. This previously wasn't the case and the old website had bad mobile compatibility. <br><br> The redesign therefore had to be conscious of the different devices it was going to be viewed on.</p></div>
        <div class="projects"><img class="dimensions" src="assets/website_design_project_cards.png"></div>
        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">The new website was also going to function differently from the old one. It needed to give users quick access to Turinglab's courses, challenges and projects.<br><br> This would hopefully increase the sign up flow to Turinglab's platform.</p></div>
        <div class="projects"><img class="dimensions" src="./assets/website_design_challenge_cards.png"></div>
        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">Turinglab has many different clients. Schools, teachers, students, big organisations and non-profits. <br><br> We decided the website would have a 'light' and 'dark' mode. The light mode would appeal to younger users and the dark mode would be more suitable for older students and potential partners.</p></div>
        <div class="projects"><img class="dimensions" src="./assets/website_design_colours.png"></div>
        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">Before creating the UI for the new site we had to have a big think about how our new user flow was going to best fit together<br><br>This, of course, required a whole bunch of different wireframes for A-B testing.</p></div>
        <div class="projects"><img class="dimensions" src="./assets/website_design_blueprint.png"></div>
        <div class="project_text"><p class="text_box">A new site meant a new user flow. <br><br>Users would now land on the splash page and have quick access to Turinglab's learning materials. We had to think carefully about how all this was going to fit together.</p></div>
